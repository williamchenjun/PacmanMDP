# Pacman MDP Agent

## Task
The goal is to create a reinforcement learning model for Pacman using Markov decision processes (MDP) such as value iteration or policy iteration. The MDP model should work both on medium sized maps and small maps. This assignment prohibits the use of any other learning algorithm and strictly requires the use of value or policy iteration.

You can find the rest of the Pacman game files on [UC Berkley's official website](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). You only need to move the `mdpAgents.py` file to the pacman game folder, where all the other agents are.

The file is documented, thus, you can easily read through it to understand each step of my solution.
